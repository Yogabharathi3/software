## RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM
## DATE:07.03.2024,14.03.2024
## AIM:
To develop the Railway Reservation System using Star UML tool.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
An E-Ticket (Electronic ticket) is a paperless electronic document
used for ticketing passengers, particularly in the commercial airline, railway industries.  

An E-Ticket offers many advantages for both travelers and
airline includingsecurity, flexibility and cost convenience. At the
same time, it also providesthe standard assurance of the
traditional paper ticket, scaling choice, travel time options and
other flexibilities. 

Passengers typically print out copies of their E-Ticket including
confirmation E-mail and other document. All those documents can
be replaced by pulling them out of the computeragain and only a
person with proper identification canactually use an E-Ticket. 

E-Ticket passengers can receive everything from gate assignments to cancellation or delay through E-mail, text messages sent to their home orbusiness computers or to their cell phones.

Finally, using E-Ticket is a more environmental friendly approach. The mainpurpose of the online bus ticket system is to provide
another way for transnational customers to buy their tickets.
